-- Subagent dispatch.
--
-- A subagent is a full session with a smaller tool set, its own context and no
-- interface. It exists to keep long or repetitive work out of the main
-- conversation: the parent pays for one paragraph of report instead of forty tool
-- results, and a search that goes nowhere costs the main context nothing.
--
-- Depth is capped because a subagent that can spawn subagents indefinitely is a
-- fork bomb with a token bill.
